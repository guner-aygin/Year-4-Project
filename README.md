# Year-4-Project
Master's Project on Stellar Activity Prediction using Probabilistic Machine Learning

This project is due to finish around May 2023. The goal for this project is to develop machine learning techniques and apply them to Solar Activity data, which shows how the number of sunspots on the Sun varies over time, to predict future Solar Cycles.
